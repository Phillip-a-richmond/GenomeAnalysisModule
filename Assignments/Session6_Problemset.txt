Final Problem Set (Session 6)


1) You know the drill.  Make a problemset directory <LASTNAME_FIRSTNAME> inside of:
/global/scratch/ARC_Training/Session6/Problemset/



2) Copy this file there:
/global/scratch/ARC_Training/Session6/Problemset/Session6_Problemset.txt



3) Copy these Fastq files into your directory:



4) Make a PBS script that has the full pipeline for RNA seq analysis:

A) Hisat2 alignment
B) Samtools file format conversion
C) stringtie transcript assembly
D) Stringtie transcript quantification


For these samples:
ILS_S_1
ILS_S_2
ISS_S_2
ISS_S_3


5) Transfer the .sorted.bam, .sorted.bam.bai, and .gtf onto your computer

6) Visualize all 4 samples (bam and gtf) for this coordinate window:

chr13: - 

And take a snapshot.


7) Pull the per-transcript coverage (cov) from the ballgown file:

t_data.ctab

for ONLY genes on chr13, and each of the samples (hint cut), and save it into a file.

Use the paste command to create a combined file with this format (using the
cov files from above):

chromosome	start	end	transcriptID	ILS_S_1cov	ILS_S_2cov	ISS_S_2cov	ISS_S_3cov


8) Copy the first 20 lines of that file here: 

chromosome      start   end     transcriptID    ILS_S_1cov      ILS_S_2cov	ISS_S_2cov      ISS_S_3cov




9) What is your favourite funny (& appropriate) youtube video? Paste the link below:
(P.S.) If you don't have one, go find one on www.youtube.com.



10) Download this file and send it to Phil along with your snapshot from #6

In preparation for tomorrow's Jasleen Grewal Experience:
