# Problem Set 2

## Overview
In this problem set, you will create a shell script to map and convert raw read data.
Then, you will download the mapped reads to your computer, and visualize the data in IGV.
Then send the image to Phil via Slack.

1) Make a ProblemSet2 directory within your workshop directory.
/mnt/scratch/Public/TRAINING/GenomeAnalysisModule/StudentSpaces/<YourDir>/ProblemSet2

2) Choose your sample from this directory, and copy it to your ProblemSet2 directory.
/mnt/scratch/Public/TRAINING/GenomeAnalysisModule/Files/

Sample Assignments are:
Kelvin - HG03006.chr19.subregion_R*fastq
Mitch - HG01583.chr19.subregion_R*fastq
Sophie - HG03052.chr19.subregion_R*fastq
Sydney - NA19648.chr19.subregion_R*fastq
Tessa - NA20845.chr19.subregion_R*fastq
Yvette - NA20502.chr19.subregion_R*fastq

3) Create a shell script in your ProbelmSet2 directory called: MapAndConvert_ProblemSet2.sh

4) Add the commands to it for mapping the reads with BWA mem against the GRCh38 genome.

GRCh38 Genome is here:

/mnt/common/DATABASES/REFERENCES/GRCh38/GENOME/GRCh38-lite.fa

5) Add the command to the shell script to convert the sam file into a bam.

6) Add the command to the shell script to sort the bam file.

7) Add the command to the shell script to index the sorted bam file.

8) Run the entire shell script using:

sh MapAndConvert_ProblemSet2.sh

9) Download the output sorted bam (.sorted.bam) and sorted bam index (.sorted.bam.bai) onto your computer using FileZilla

10) Open the files in IGV on your computer.

11) Zoom to the region with reads mapped and take a snapshot called ProblemSet2.png.

12) Upload your snapshot to your ProblemSet2 Directory.

13) Send Phil a message on slack when you are done!
