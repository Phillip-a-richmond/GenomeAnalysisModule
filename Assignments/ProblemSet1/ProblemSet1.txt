Manraj Randhawa; November 3, 2020.This problem set will review the basic commands from the lecture, and add some new commands I didn't teach you (GASP!!!)

The examples in this problem set will also guide you through exploring different file formats commonly used in genomics.  
For help with file formats, use...the Internet!  


1) Create a "Problemset directory" with your last name and first initial in all caps within:

/mnt/scratch/Public/TRAINING/GenomeAnalysisModule/StudentSpaces/<YourDirName>/ProblemSet1/

2) Copy this Session1 Problem set into your Problemset directory:
/mnt/scratch/Public/TRAINING/GenomeAnalysisModule/Assignments/ProblemSet1/ProblemSet1.txt

3) Copy this file into your Problemset directory:
/mnt/scratch/Public/TRAINING/GenomeAnalysisModule/Files/genes.gff3

3) Rename the file to be called: hg38_genes.gff3

4) Extract all lines that correspond to the gene "GRN", and save them in a file called GRN.gff3 

5) Double check your GRN.gff3 to make sure it only has lines corresponding to GRN in it.  
If it doesn't, redo your command in #4 using the whole-word option from the grep command.

6) Extract all lines that correspond to the gene "TTN", and save them in a file called TTN.gff3 

7) Delete the smaller of the two gff3 files: GRN.gff3 and TTN.gff3

8) Make a BED file (chromosome,start,stop tab separated) of the CDS entries for TTN called TTN.bed
(hint cut -f)

9) Download the clinvar vcf file into your Problemset Directory:
ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/clinvar/vcf_GRCh38/clinvar.vcf.gz

10) Unzip the clinvar.vcf.gz file

11) Extract all variant lines corresponding to the gene GLS from the clinvar file into a file called:
GLS_clinvar.vcf

12) Check the number of lines in the GLS_clinvar.vcf file.

13) Extract all variant lines corresponding to the gene SLC6A8 from the clinvar.vcf file into a file called:
SLC6A8_clinvar.vcf

14) Concatenate the GLS_clinvar.vcf and SLC6A8_clinvar.vcf files into a single file called combined_clinvar.vcf

15) Extract the header lines (starting with "#") from the file clinvar.vcf and add them to the top of combined_clinvar.vcf to make a new file called:
GLS_SLC6A8_clinvar.vcf

16) Compress the file GLS_SLC6A8_clinvar.vcf using gzip

17) Change the permissions on your Problemset directory to be read, write, and execute for user, group, and world.

18) Edit this file, and put your name at the top, with the date.

19) Send the completed worksheet to prichmond@bcchr.ca

20) Pat yourself on the back. You are amazing!
